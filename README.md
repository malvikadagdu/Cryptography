# Cryptography
This is a client server secure communication network created with python wherein the Client connects with the server and the server requests a username and password. Only after entering the correct username and password can the further steps be taken. I have used Diffie Hellman Algorithm here to encrypt the data between the server and client. Once authentication is done, the client can request data/histogram from a toy database through the server. On making such a request the server grants the data ensuring secure communication is maintained throughout the process using Diffie Hellman. Steps: Run the server and the client files on a local host. Enter the username and password as requested by the server and as mentioned in the code. Once authentication is approved a secure communication network is established. Now request data/histogram from the toy data base through the server.
